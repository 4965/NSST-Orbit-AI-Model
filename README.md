This code uses Euler's method to solve the differential equations that describe the motion of a satellite in orbit around the Earth.
It calculates the position and velocity of the satellite at each time step, and stores the data in arrays. Finally, it plots the trajectory using matplotlib. You can adjust the values of the constants and initial conditions to simulate different orbits.
